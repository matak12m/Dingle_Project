Visual Novel for Animation Dingle.


SYNOPSIS:

It's your first time going to Animation Dingle, and you find yourself needing to kill some time before it starts. That's when you encounter An Phiast and Fungie, who seem to be at odds with each other. They're both Mascots, after all, and seem to have quite the rivalry. An Phiast offers to show you around the town before the event. Visit the different locations of Dingle, learning more about both the locale, as well as the story behind their feud. Will you befriend An Phiast, see past Fungie's posturing, or maybe, figure out a way for them to reconsile?
